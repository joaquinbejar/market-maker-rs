# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format
is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `options::surface` (feature `options`): the `VolSurface` trait (total
  implied variance `w(k, tau)` and its derivatives at a log forward
  moneyness and a time to expiry), the validated `TotalVariance` value,
  `check_point` and a `FlatSurface`. Model arithmetic there is `f64`, an
  explicit exception documented in the module (#95, #96).

### Changed

- `BacktestEngine::faults` keeps only the first `MAX_RECORDED_FAULTS` (16)
  errors; `BacktestEngine::fault_count` reports the total. Admission still
  stops at the first fault (#133).

### Breaking

- No panics in library code (#135). New `MMError::LockPoisoned`; these now
  return `MMResult` instead of panicking on a poisoned lock:
  `ThreadSafeOrderManager::{read, write, get_stats, open_order_count,
  check_timeouts, cleanup}`, `CollectingAlertHandler::{alerts, count, clear}`,
  `MockExchangeConnector::{set_balance, open_order_count, all_order_ids}` and
  `OrderBookConnector::set_balance`. `AlertHandler::handle` returns
  `MMResult<()>`; `AlertManager::{alert, alert_with_message}` deliver to every
  handler and return the first handler error. `GridConfig::new` rejects
  `levels_per_side > i32::MAX`; `AccountingFill::cash_flow` and
  `LimitsPolicy::live_quantity` return `NumericalError` on overflow; position,
  PnL, notional and slippage values saturate at the `Decimal` bounds.
  `OrderBookConnector::{with_config, from_orderbook}` return `MMResult<Self>`
  and reject a price or quantity precision above the new `MAX_PRECISION`
  (19), also checked by the new `OrderBookConnectorConfig::validate`; orders
  with a non positive price, a negative quantity or an out of range value
  return `NumericalError` instead of being saturated. `LiveMetrics::{
  update_position, update_pnl, update_realized_pnl, update_unrealized_pnl,
  add_realized_pnl, reset}` return `MMResult<()>`, `LiveMetrics::{
  get_position, get_realized_pnl, get_unrealized_pnl}` return
  `MMResult<Decimal>`, `LiveMetrics::snapshot` returns
  `MMResult<MetricsSnapshot>` and `MetricsBridge::sync` returns
  `MMResult<()>`: a poisoned lock is `LockPoisoned` and a PnL overflow is
  `NumericalError`. A poisoned `MarginAccount` rejects orders and returns
  `LockPoisoned` from event and fill booking until reset, and `fault()`
  reports it. `VolatilityEstimator::{calculate_simple, calculate_ewma}`
  need at least 3 prices; `RiskAversionCalibrator::calibrate_from_history`
  rejects an empty history. `RiskLimits::check_order` and
  `ManagedOrder::record_fill` return `NumericalError` on overflow;
  `MarketImpactFillModel` fills return `NumericalError` when the impact
  overflows. With `max_position` not positive, `RiskLimits::scale_order_size`
  returns zero and `position_utilization` returns `Decimal::MAX`.
  `AlertManager` deduplicates per handler: a handler that delivered an
  alert type inside the window is skipped and one that failed is retried.
  `OrderBookConnector` accepts every raw price that converts exactly to a
  `Decimal` and rejects one that would be rounded, and holds the order mapping lock across book updates.

- Backtest fees can be charged in the base asset or a third asset:
  `BacktestConfig::fee_currency` (`FeeCurrency::{Quote, Base, Other}`,
  default `Quote`, unchanged behaviour). `FeeAsset` moved to
  `types::fee` (still re-exported from `backtest`), gained
  `Other(String)` and is no longer `Copy`. `OrderEvent::Fill` has a new
  `fee_asset` field. `MarginLedgerAccountant` and the margin policy book
  base fees on the base asset instead of refusing them. `FeeAsset` is
  `#[non_exhaustive]`. A base fee reduces the base held: the engine,
  strategy and `LimitsPolicy` positions are net of base fees, which are
  marked at the current mid in `total_fees`. `SimulatedFill` gains
  `base_fee` and `base_delta()`, and `AccountingSnapshot` gains
  `base_fees`, whose `fees` now covers quote fees only (#127).
- `BacktestResult` has a new public field `accounting: AccountingStatus`
  (accountant description and the execution ids it refused), and
  `SimulatedFill` has a new public field `execution_id: Option<u64>`
  (`None` from its constructors, set by the engine); struct literals of
  either type need the new field (#126).
- The order direction is the shared `financial_types::Action`, which
  replaces both local `Side { Buy, Sell }` enums (`execution::Side` and
  `events::Side`). It is re-exported as `execution::Action`,
  `events::Action` and from the prelude. Replace `Side::Buy` and
  `Side::Sell` with `Action::Buy` and `Action::Sell`; `is_buy()`,
  `is_sell()` and `opposite()` keep working (`Action::opposite()` maps
  `Other` to itself).
- `events::OptionStyle` is the shared `financial_types::OptionStyle`, the
  same type as `optionstratlib::OptionStyle`.
- `Action` is `#[non_exhaustive]` and has an `Other` variant, so a `match`
  on it outside this crate needs a wildcard arm. This crate supports only
  `Buy` and `Sell`.
- New error variant `MMError::UnsupportedAction { action }`, returned for
  `Action::Other` before any state changes by:
  - `ExchangeConnector::submit_order` of `MockExchangeConnector` and
    `OrderBookConnector` (no order id is consumed);
  - `OrderManager::register_order`, `OrderManager::register_order_checked`
    (before the policy is asked) and `OrderManager::record_fill`;
  - `SimOrder::validate`, `SimOrder::accept` and `SimOrder::apply_fill`
    (`SimOrder::reject` and `SimOrder::cancel` accept any side, to take
    such an order out);
  - `MarginLedgerAccountant::post_fill`;
  - the methods whose signature changed, listed below.
- Signature changes:
  - now `MMResult<Decimal>` instead of `Decimal`: `Fill::net_value`,
    `OrderManager::get_open_quantity`,
    `ThreadSafeOrderManager::get_open_quantity`,
    `LimitsPolicy::live_quantity`, `AccountingFill::signed_quantity`,
    `AccountingFill::cash_flow` and
    `ProbabilisticFillModel::calculate_probability`;
  - `ManagedOrder::record_fill` returns `MMResult<()>` (it checks the
    fill's side and the order's own side);
  - `FillModel::simulate_fill` returns `MMResult<FillResult>`; the built-in
    models return `UnsupportedAction` for an unsupported side without
    touching their state (the probabilistic model does not advance its
    generator);
  - `PretradePolicy::on_order_event` returns `MMResult<()>` (the default
    implementation returns `Ok(())`).
- Pretrade policies and `Action::Other`:
  - `PretradePolicy::check` of `LimitsPolicy` and `MarginRiskPolicy`
    returns `PretradeDecision::Rejected`, before any state changes;
  - a fill with that side is unknown exposure: `on_order_event` returns
    `UnsupportedAction`, books nothing and does not consume the execution
    id, and latches a fault (`LimitsPolicy::fault`,
    `MarginAccount::fault`). While the fault is set, every `check` is
    rejected; `reset` clears it.
- `BacktestEngine` records any error of the fill model or the pretrade
  policy in `BacktestEngine::faults` and, from the first one, refuses every
  new quote (reported as `Rejected`, without asking the policy) until
  `reset`. Resting orders keep working.
- Serialization:
  - the JSON of `MarketMakerEvent` is unchanged: sides are still
    `"buy"`/`"sell"` and option styles `"call"`/`"put"`, and other
    spellings are still rejected. Serializing an event whose side is
    `Action::Other` fails;
  - serializing `Action` or `OptionStyle` directly, outside an event, now
    gives `"Buy"`/`"Sell"` and `"Call"`/`"Put"`. This matches the former
    `execution::Side`, but not the former `events::Side` and
    `events::OptionStyle`, which serialized in lowercase.
- The crate declares `rust-version = "1.95"`. This is not a new
  requirement of this change: the dependency graph already needed Rust
  1.95 before it, because `orderbook-rs` 0.15.1 (a required dependency
  that declares no `rust-version`) uses atomic `try_update`, stable since
  1.95. `financial_types` itself needs only 1.88.

### Added

- `BacktestEngine::faults`, `LimitsPolicy::fault` and
  `MarginAccount::fault`.
- Dependency `financial_types = "0.3"`. It derives `serde` unconditionally,
  so `serde` is now compiled in the default build too; the `serde` feature
  still gates this crate's own serialization support.
- `make msrv` checks the crate with the declared minimum Rust version, with
  no features and with all features.
